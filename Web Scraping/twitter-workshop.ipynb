    "Ever since the launch of Twitter in 2006, researchers from various disciplines (e.g. Sociology, Linguistics, Computer Science, Folklore, etc.) have been interested in the social networking service. The service gained worldwide popularity, and nowadays, Twitter has more than 500 million registered users, out of which about 332 million are active. Every second, about 6000 tweets are produced on Twitter, which corresponds to 360,000 tweets per minute, about 518 million tweets per day and around 200 billion tweets per year. As such, Twitter hosts a massive amount of accessible messages, which in turn harbor vast amounts of information about numerous subjects and topics. \n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "The massive amounts of data require new tools, such as robust data-retrieval and data-mining methods, that can be employed to efficiently analyze the Twitter stream. In this workshop, we will create a small application to automatically 'scrape' large amounts of tweets from Twitter. In order to efficiently analyze these large amounts of tweets, we need tools to automatically convert the tweets in a more accessible and user-friendly format. Therefore, the second part of this workshop will be devoted to creating another application, which allows us to preprocess the data for doing textual analysis. Finally, in the third and last part of this workshop, we will start digging into some basic techniques for visualizing our data."
