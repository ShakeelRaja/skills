    "In computer programming, a variable is a storage location (identified by a memory address) paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. The variable name is used to reference the stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself. This separation of name and content/value allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. \n",
